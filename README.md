Securing network traffic is a broad topic, but I'll outline basic steps focusing on common practices for inspecting and protecting traffic within an organization. This isn't an exhaustive guide, but rather a foundational approach.

Traffic Logging and Analysis:
Concept: Collect logs from all network devices (firewalls, routers, switches, servers) detailing connection attempts, traffic flows, and security events.
Why: Provides an audit trail and allows you to identify anomalies, suspicious activities, and potential security incidents.
You're asking about the rules for traffic police stopping cars, specifically in Durg, Chhattisgarh, and likely about "speeding" (which you spelled as "speelling"). Let's break this down based on Indian traffic laws, which are generally uniform across states but with specific penalty variations.

Traffic Police Rules for Stopping Cars in Durg (and India generally)
Traffic police have the authority to stop vehicles for various reasons, primarily to enforce the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 (and its 2019 amendments) and state-specific rules like the Chhattisgarh Motor Vehicles Rules, 1994.

Here's a summary of their powers and your rights when stopped:

Reasons for Stopping a Car:

Traffic Violation: If a traffic police officer witnesses a traffic violation (e.g., signal jumping, overspeeding, not wearing a seatbelt/helmet, using a mobile phone, dangerous driving, driving without a valid license, drunk driving, etc.).
Routine Check: Traffic police can conduct routine checks to ensure road safety and verify vehicle documents. This is a common practice to ensure compliance.
Specific Drive/Campaign: Sometimes, police conduct special drives targeting specific violations (e.g., drunk driving checks, pollution control checks, document verification).
Suspicion of Crime: If there is a reasonable suspicion that the vehicle or its occupants are involved in a criminal activity.
Information/Assistance: They might stop you to provide important information (e.g., road closure, accident ahead) or to seek assistance in an emergency.
Your Rights and What to Do When Stopped:

Remain Calm and Cooperate: Pull over safely to the side of the road. Do not try to evade or argue.
Officer's Uniform and Identification: The traffic police officer must be in uniform with their name and buckle number clearly displayed. You have the right to ask for their identification if it's not visible.
Reason for Stopping: You can politely inquire about the reason for being stopped.
Documents: You are required to produce the following documents upon demand by any police officer in uniform:
